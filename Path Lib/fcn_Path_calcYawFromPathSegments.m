function yaw_angles_in_radians = fcn_Path_calcYawFromPathSegments(Path,varargin)
% fcn_Path_calcYawFromPathSegments
% Calculates the yaw angles of the path segments. If there are N points
% in the path, there are N-1 segments and thus N-1 angles. 
%
% The method used for calculating the path angles is to use the first
% segment of the path to calculate the angle of this segment, using the
% arctangent function (atan2). For any subsequent segments, if any, the
% change in angles is calculated using the dot product and cross product,
% and these angle changes are then cumulatively added to determine yaw
% angles thereafter. This method with the dot product and the cross product
% allows us to avoid errors caused by angle rollover that occurs with the
% arctangent functions. Thus, a path that circles clockwise two times will
% have a yaw angle that starts somewhere between -pi and pi, and decreases
% by abou 4 pi, or two revolutions. Note that the angle convention for yaw
% follows Cartesian definitions, namely yaw is positive when angles
% increase counter-clockwise, and yaw angles start at 0 at the x-axis.
