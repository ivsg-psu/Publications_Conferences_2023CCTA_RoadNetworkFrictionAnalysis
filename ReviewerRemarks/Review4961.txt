Comments to the author
======================

The double simulation procedure is well explained and
reproducible, and the work methodology is coherent
throughout the paper.
There only one part less clear: in section 2A, a 7-DOF
vehicle model is introduced, however, it is unclear which
are the states of this model, and how the single-wheel
rotational speed is controlled by the wheel slip controller
if those dynamics are neglected in the simulation.
Also, it comes to the mind of the reader to ask why did you
use a brush tire model, especially concerning the
computational problems you encountered, while the Pacejka
model is much simpler computationally wise.

Minor comment: 5 lines after defining equation (5), you
refer to it as equation (4)
