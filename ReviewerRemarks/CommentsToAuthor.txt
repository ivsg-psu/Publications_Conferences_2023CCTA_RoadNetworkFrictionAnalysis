Comments to author (Associate Editor)
=====================================

The reviewers have provided comments on the paper.  While
they all agree on the quality of the presentation and the
potential interest of the work. Two reviewers have raised
concerns on the quality of the work and very useful
feedbacks.  In particular, the authors should consider, the
following aspects:

- neglecting the vertical load when discussing tyre
characteristics may lead to wrong conclusions. This should
be considered.

- The method should not only consider nominal road
conditions, but wet/snowy and icy roads are important to
consider.

- The need for a traffic simulator should be better
discussed.
